# Sentiment Analysis and Suggestion
We will be performing a sentiment analysis about SIA using Twitter posts and from there, make suggestions for improvement.

### How to run?:
1. Download `SIA_AppChallenge_Final.ipynb`, `openAIRes.txt` and `sia_tweets.json`. Ensure that all these files are in the same directory.

2. We recommend using Jupyter Notebook or any other notebook program that are local as you would have to import the other 2 files.

3. Run the cells from the first to the end. Ensure that the previous cell has finished running before going on to the next one.

4. Skip those that are optional as they require API keys. If you have the API keys for the product, you may insert your API keys to test them out. These components have been previously generated by us and you can just import the files into the notebook with the codes we provided.
